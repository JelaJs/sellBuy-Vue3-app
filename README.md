# buySellApp

This app is crafted using Vue 3 with the Composition API, Vite, and Firebase.

Designed for users looking to buy or sell items, the application offers a platform to discover products of interest along with comprehensive details about each listing and its seller.

Users have the ability to log in, leave comments, and directly contact sellers through the app. Additionally, authenticated users can post their own products, which are then showcased alongside other listings. They retain the flexibility to edit or delete their listings at any time.
